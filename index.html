            <p>At a high level, digital marketing refers to advertising delivered through digital 
              channels such as search engines, websites, social media, email, and mobile apps.
               Using these online media channels, digital marketing is the method by which companies
                endorse goods, services, and brands. Consumers heavily rely on digital means to
                 research products. For example, Think with Google marketing insights found that
                  48% of consumers start their inquiries on search engines, while 33% look to brand
                   websites and 26% search within mobile applications.</p>

          <p>While modern day digital marketing is an enormous system of channels to which marketers simply must onboard their brands, advertising online is much more complex than the channels alone. In order to achieve the true potential of digital marketing, marketers have to dig deep into todayâ€™s vast and intricate cross-channel world to discover strategies that make an impact through engagement marketing. Engagement marketing is the method of forming meaningful interactions with potential and returning customers based on the data you collect over time. By engaging customers in a digital landscape, you build brand awareness, set yourself as an industry thought leader, and place your business at the forefront when the customer is ready to buy.</p>
          <p>By implementing an omnichannel digital marketing strategy, marketers can collect valuable insights into target audience behaviors while opening the door to new methods of customer engagement. Additionally, companies can expect to see an increase in retention. According to a report by Invesp, companies with strong omnichannel customer engagement strategies retain an average of 89% of their customers compared to companies with weak omnichannel programs that have a retention rate of just 33%. </p>
          <p>As for the future of digital marketing, we can expect to see a continued increase in the variety of wearable devices available to consumers. Forbes also forecasts that social media will become increasingly conversational in the B2B space, video content will be refined for search engine optimization (SEO) purposes, and email marketing will become even more personalized.</p>
